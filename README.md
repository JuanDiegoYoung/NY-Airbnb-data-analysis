This repository contains the technical assessment for pyxis.tech.

It consists of two parts:

1 - Data exploration and cleaning of a dataset containing Airbnb price information across different neighborhoods in New York.

2 - Wine classification based on physical and chemical characteristics.

You will find notebooks with the development of each challenge, as well as two additional notebooks with the functions used in each case.

The proposal is also attached as a `.txt` file.
